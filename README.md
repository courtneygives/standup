Aint that great?

## Standup
Standup (a.k.a. Scrum) in the world of software is typically a meeting of fewer than 10 people. For the purpose of keeping the meeting very short, participants actually do *stand up* together. Each person has some time to talk about plans and needs for the day. We don't necessarily know each other or work together, so we're doing things our way.


## Procedure ("our way")
1. Start the meeting no later than one or two minutes past the appointed time, because a) we don't know who's showing up, necessarily, and b) we want this to be short so you can go on with your life.
2. Each person has 30-90 seconds to answer three questions: 
  - What have you worked on since the last meeting / yesterday?
  - What will you work on after this meeting?
  - What is getting inhibiting your progress? 
  

# Vote plz.
Vote on the time that is most likely to work for you each day (Weekends probably not included) to hop on a voice/video meeting.

You would just be encouraged to attend __one per day__, not both morning and evening.
