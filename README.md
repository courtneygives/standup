#This is going to run itself. 
Aint that great?

## Standup
Standup (a.k.a. Scrum) in the world of software is typically a meeting of fewer than 10 people. For the purpose of keeping the meeting very short, participants actually do *stand up* together. Each person has some time to talk about plans and needs for the day. We don't necessarily know each other or work together, so we're doing things our way.


- **Gitter** - any-time chat room: [gitter.im/sun-paws](http://gitter.im/sun-paws)
- **Talky** - browser-based meeting tool: [talky.io/sun-paws](http://talky.io/sun-paws)

## Standup Procedure (our way)
1. Go to talky.io/sun-paws in a browser and get ready for talking on camera!
2. Start the meeting at the appointed time, because:
 - we don't know who's showing up.
 - we want this to be quick!
3. Each person has 30-90 seconds to answer three questions: 
  - What have you worked on since the last meeting / yesterday?
  - What will you work on after this meeting?
  - What is getting inhibiting your progress?
4. Go to our chat room, if you want to, at any time: gitter.im/sun-paws

##  Do I have to be on camera?
No. But here's why I think you should do it anyway: 

- It's kinda awkward-- I know, but it will get better.
- It really improves the experience and realness of the meeting.
- If you are willing to turn on your camera, thank you!


# Vote plz.
Vote on the time that is most likely to work for you each day (weekends probably not included) to hop on a voice/video meeting.

- You would just be encouraged to attend __one per day__, not both morning and evening.
