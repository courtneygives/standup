# This is going to run itself
Aint that great?

## Reasons
It would be so helpful to have people to tell my daily/weekly work plans to who are in the software world. I'm a team of one, so that's why this is something I'd really benefit from, to stay organized and feel less isolated. I looked around the room I was in to help me pick a random sounding name for a group... so here it is: __Sun Paws__

## Standup
Standup (a.k.a. Scrum) in the world of software is typically a meeting of fewer than 10 people. For the purpose of keeping the meeting very short, participants actually do *stand up* together. Each person has some time to talk about plans and needs for the day. We don't necessarily know each other or work together, so we're doing things our way.


- **Gitter** - any-time chat room: [gitter.im/sun-paws](http://gitter.im/sun-paws)
- **Talky** - browser-based meeting tool: [talky.io/sun-paws](http://talky.io/sun-paws)

# Vote plz.
Vote on the time that is most likely to work for you each day (weekends probably not included) to hop on a voice/video meeting.

- You would just be encouraged to attend __one per day__, not both morning and evening.

## Standup Procedure (our way)
1. Go to [talky.io/sun-paws](http://talky.io/sun-paws) in a browser and get ready for talking on camera!
2. Start the meeting at the appointed time, because:
 - we don't know who's showing up.
 - we want this to be quick!
3. Each person has 30-90 seconds to answer three questions: 
  - What have you worked on since the last meeting / yesterday?
  - What will you work on after this meeting?
  - What is getting inhibiting your progress?
4. Go to our chat room, if you want to, at any time: [gitter.im/sun-paws](http://gitter.im/sun-paws)


##  Do I have to be on camera?
No! Fear of speaking and being in the spotlight is a very real thing for many of us. I want you to attend --even without your camera on-- first and foremost.
- For most of us it's kinda awkward-- I know, but it will get better.
- It really improves the experience and realness of the meeting.
- If you are willing to turn on your camera, thank you!

## I have too many dang chat groups and programs!
I use a program on deskdop called __[Franz](http://meetfranz.com/)__ that puts Slack, Gitter, Hangouts, FB Messenger, etc in one application. It's great.
